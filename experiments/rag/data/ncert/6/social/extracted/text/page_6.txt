Exploring Society: India and Beyond
develop harmoniously without a sound economy. But how 
does an economy work, especially in a huge country like 
India? What exactly is money? Where does it come from? 
How can it be increased? What economic activities can 
people engage themselves in? How are natural and human 
resources best managed? This theme will lay down some of 
the important concepts and practices that will enable us to 
answer these questions.

You will notice that there are many questions in the 
preceding paragraphs. This is as it should be — Social 
Science is also about the art of asking the right questions. 
Only then can we start looking for the right answers. This 
also explains the presence of ‘Big Questions’ at the start of 
each chapter in this book.
You may also be intrigued to find a game of chess and 
some ancient Tamil poetry in chapters that apparently deal 
with geography; a discussion on the uses of the sari in a 
chapter on cultural heritage; the concept of sevā and the 
mention of festivals in chapters focusing on economics. 
This is deliberate. We believe in bringing elements from 
diverse fields together (you will learn later that this is 
called ‘multidisciplinarity’). This enriches our perspective. 
Indeed, life constantly mixes numerous elements together, 
so why should we not?
By now, it should be clear that although Social Science 
makes constant use of the past, it seeks to make sense of 
the present so as to help us prepare a better future. It is an 
exploration and an adventure.
