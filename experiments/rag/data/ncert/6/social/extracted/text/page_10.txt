experienced the first two while navigating the map in Fig. 
1.1. Let us now define them more precisely.
Have you ever wondered how a huge place can fit on a small 
piece of paper? It is all thanks to the map’s scale. Let us go 
back to our map of a small city (Fig. 1.1). Each centimetre 
on the map, as printed here, represents a certain distance 
on the ground — let us suppose it is 500 metres; we say that 
the scale is 1 cm = 500 m. Now, turn to the map of India in  
Fig. 5.2 in Chapter 5 of this textbook. The scale is repre-
sented in the bottom left corner by a ruler with ‘500’ written 
above its length and ‘km’ on the side. It simply means that 
this ruler, which measures 2.5 cm in the printed map, 
corresponds to 500 kilometres on the ground.   
So, the actual distance between two points represented on 
the map depends on the scale that the map is using.
LET’S EXPLORE
	
Æ
Draw a simple map of a school’s playground. Let us 
assume it is a rectangle, 40 m in length and 30 m in width. 
Draw it precisely with your ruler on a scale of 1 cm = 10 m.
	
Æ
Now measure the diagonal of the rectangle. How many 
centimetres do you get? Using the scale, calculate the real 
length of the playground’s diagonal, in metres.
Let us return to the four arrows at the top right 
of the small city’s map. They point to four 
directions, which are north, at the top, and, 
moving clockwise, east, south and west. 
These are called the cardinal directions, 
also cardinal points. Other than these, 
intermediate directions are also used — 
northeast (NE), southeast (SE), southwest 
(SW) and northwest (NW). Most maps 
simply have an arrow marked with the 
letter ‘N’, which points to the north direction.
