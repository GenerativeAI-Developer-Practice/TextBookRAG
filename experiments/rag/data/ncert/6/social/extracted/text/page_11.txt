Taking your school as the starting point, do you know 
approximately in which cardinal direction your home is 
located? Discuss with your teacher and your parents.
Symbols are another important component of maps. Our 
map has small drawings of actual buildings and a few  
other elements, but there would not be enough space on the 
map of a large city or a country to draw them all. Instead, 
a symbol is used to represent these features — symbols for 
different kinds of buildings (for instance a railway station, 
a school, a post office), for roads and railway lines, and for 
natural elements such as a river, a pond or a forest. In that 
way, numerous details can be shown in the limited space 
available on a map.
To make maps more easily understood by a variety of users, 
map makers use specific symbols. Different countries use 
different sets of symbols. The Survey of India, a government 
body, has fixed a set of symbols for maps of India (or parts 
of India). A small selection of them is shown in Fig. 1.2 on 
page 12.
 LET’S EXPLORE
Draw a rough map of your locality or your village, including 
your home, school and a few other important landmarks. Show 
the cardinal directions and use a few of the symbols shown in 
Fig. 1.2 on page 12 to mark some important features.
