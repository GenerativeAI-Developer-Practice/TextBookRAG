Exploring Society: India and Beyond  
India and the World: Land and the People
Imagine that you are visiting a city for the first time. How 
would you find the places you want to visit? You might ask 
a local person for help, or you might look at a map of the 
city. In previous grades, you learnt a little about maps, and 
in this chapter, we will study them in more detail. 
Let us play a game. Examine the map of this small city  
(Fig. 1.1). Imagine that you just got off a train at the railway 
station, and you want to visit the bank marked on the 
map. Which way would you go? Are there other possible 
ways? Can you locate the public garden, the school and 
the museum? If you want to proceed from the bank to the 
market, which way will you go? This is where a map comes 
in handy!
A map is like a treasure guide; it shows you where things 
are and how to get to them. Notice the four arrows in the top 
right corner of the map; we will soon see how they point to 
some specific directions and make maps even more helpful.
