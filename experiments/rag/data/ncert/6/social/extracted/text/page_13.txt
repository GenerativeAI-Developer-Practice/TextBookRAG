1 – Locating Places on the Earth
Here we will study the globe representing 
the Earth’s geography. Because the globe 
and the Earth have the same spherical 
shape, a globe will better represent the 
geography of the Earth than a flat map. 
Let us now explore some of its features.
a) Understanding coordinates
Imagine a big market in a city or town, with 
neat rows of shops, all the same size. You 
want to meet a friend at a stationery shop 
inside the market. But your friend does 
not know where the shop is. So you would give directions 
like, “Meet me at 6 pm at the 7th shop in the 5th row from 
the entrance.” This will allow your friend to precisely  
determine your location. 
Now, consider a chessboard. 
To record moves by advanced 
players, letters are placed 
alongside the main pieces 
(from ‘a’ to ‘h’, see the image) 
and numbers (from 1 to 8) in 
between the two sides. This 
simple system allows players 
to mark each square and 
record every move. Here, the 
white side has just opened the 
game by moving the queen’s 
pawn two squares forward (a 
very common opening). So, 
the pawn is said to have moved from d2 to d4.

Using the same terms, write down your move if you play black 
and respond with the same move.
