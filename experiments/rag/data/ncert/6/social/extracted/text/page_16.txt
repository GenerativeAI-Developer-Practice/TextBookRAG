the Sun illuminating the Earth. Slowly rotating the globe 
eastward, we can note that for some places on the Earth it 
is morning, while for others it is mid-day, evening or night 
— when it’s breakfast time in one country, it’s lunchtime in 
another and in a third country people are fast asleep! That 
is why by measuring the longitude of a place, we will also 
be measuring the time at that place. Let us see how. 
To measure longitudes, we need to define a reference point 
called the Prime Meridian (Fig. 1.3 on page 15). It is also 
called Greenwich Meridian because, in the year 1884, 
some nations decided that the meridian passing through 
Greenwich, an area of London in England, would become 
the international standard for the Prime Meridian. It is 
marked as 0° longitude. 
Just as latitude is a measure of the distance from the 
Equator if you travel towards one of the poles, longitude is 
a measure of the distance from the Prime Meridian if you 
travel along the Equator. Longitude, too, is measured in 
degrees. Westward or eastward, it increases in value from 
0° to 180°, with the letter ‘W’ or ‘E’ added. For instance, 
using round figures, New York’s longitude is 74°W, while 
Delhi’s is 77°E and Tokyo’s is 140°E.
DON’T MISS OUT
As you can see on the globe of meridians of longitudes, 180°W 
and 180°E are the same longitude; so this longitude is noted 
180°, omitting the letter W or E. 
Latitude and longitude together are the two coordinates of 
a place. With them, you are now able to locate any place on 
Earth! You can now understand a statement such as “Delhi 
lies at 29°N latitude and 77°E longitude” (these values are 
rounded off, not exact).
Fig. 1.3 on page 15 shows the parallels of latitude and the 
meridians of longitude together on the globe as blue lines.
