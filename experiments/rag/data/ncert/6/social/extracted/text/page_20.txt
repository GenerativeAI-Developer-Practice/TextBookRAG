Understanding Time Zones
Let’s make the globe rotate again from west to east — that 
is how our planet spins around its axis, making a full turn 
every 24 hours. A full turn is 360°, so this means 15° per 
hour (15 × 24 = 360). Let us now mark the meridians of 
longitude every 15°. Moving eastward from the Prime 
Meridian, we get 0°, 15°E, 30°E, 45°E, and so on every 15° 
up to 180°E. It is the same as adding one hour of local time 
with each meridian — if it is 12 pm or noon at Greenwich, it 
is 1 pm local time at 15°E, 2 pm at 30°E, and so on. But going 
westward, it is the other way round — 11 am local time at 
15°W, 10 am at 30°W, etc.
Fig. 1.7. This graph shows longitudes at the bottom and the local time at the 
top, with reference to the Prime Meridian at 0°. Each colour is a zone of 15° 
centred on a meridian.
