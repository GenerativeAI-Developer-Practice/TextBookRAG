11 — which means that travelling across Russia from east to 
west, you will need to readjust your watch 10 times to align 
with the local time!
Similarly, the globe in Fig. 1.9, centred on India, shows 
standard times with respect to GMT for a few countries. 
Finally, while the Prime Meridian was fixed at Greenwich, 
the opposite line — at approximately 180° longitude — is

As you can see on the map, the +12 and the –12 time zones

you need to change the date in your watch. If you cross it
