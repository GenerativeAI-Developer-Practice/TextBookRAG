Exploring Society: India and Beyond
methods wherever possible (you will see a few examples 
in this textbook), but its focus — human society — is, again, 
too diverse to allow the kind of set procedures and fixed 
results the sciences come up with.  
Social Science has many subdisciplines: geography, history, 
political science, economics, sociology, anthropology, 
archaeology, psychology and a few more. You need not feel 
intimidated by all these terms! While you will study some of 
these subdisciplines in the Secondary Stage, in the Middle 
Stage we have avoided this classification. Instead, we have 
opted for five broad themes. Let us briefly look at them. 
Theme A – India and the World:  
Land and the People
This first theme includes the basics of the geographical 
world around us — some of the main features of our planet 
and the way to represent them on a map. Why is this 
theme important, when today we can get excellent maps 
on a mobile phone? Because it deals with much more than 
maps. It also asks how geographical features — oceans, 
mountains, rivers, etc. — have shaped entire civilisations 
throughout their histories. It is also, in India’s case, about 
how its natural setting has contributed to giving this ancient 
civilisation a unique identity.
Theme B – Tapestry of the Past
A tapestry is a large piece of canvas-like cloth usually 
kept as a wall hanging, with pictures and designs on it — 
sometimes a historical narrative. Our tapestry is where 
we will be painting scenes from the past, beginning with 
India’s past. But why should we be at all concerned with the 
past? Because it is the key to understanding the present, and 
the chapters in this theme will often make this connection 
clear. The past is a major source for our identities — it 
helps us understand who we are and where we come from.
