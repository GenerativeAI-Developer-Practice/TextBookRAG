1 – Locating Places on the Earth
LET’S EXPLORE 
Two friends, one sitting in Porbandar (Gujarat) and the other 
in Tinsukia (Assam), are speaking on the phone late afternoon. 
The latter remarks that the sun has set in Assam and it’s 
now dark. The former is surprised and says, “But it’s still full 
daylight here!” Explain why. And, as a class activity, calculate 
the difference in local time between those two cities. (Hint: for 
now, consider the difference in longitude between Porbandar 
and Tinsukia to be 30°; later, you can find out the precise value.)
The same method can be used to calculate the local time 
of any place on the Earth. But it would not be convenient 
for a country to use many local times! That is why most 
countries adopt a standard time based on a meridian 
passing through them. Indian Standard Time (IST) is 5 
hours 30 minutes (also noted 5.5 hours) ahead of the local 
time at Greenwich (called Greenwich Mean Time or GMT).
LET’S EXPLORE
Return to the two friends sitting in Gujarat and Assam. Use 
this example to explain the difference between local time and 
standard time. 
All these standard times are organised in time zones, which 
broadly follow the zones of 15° in the graph (Fig. 1.7). But let 
us consider the world map below (Fig. 1.8). We can see that 
the lines dividing the time zones are not fully straight. This 
is because they have to respect each country’s standard time 
and, therefore, tend to follow international borders. The 
numbers written inside some countries are the numbers of 
hours to be added to GMT to get their standard times if they 
have a positive sign, or subtracted from GMT if they have a 
negative sign.
