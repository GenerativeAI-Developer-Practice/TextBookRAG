All these lines together constitute a grid for the globe; they 
are also called grid lines.
LET’S EXPLORE 
If the globe or atlas in your class has well-marked latitudes 
and longitudes, try to note down approximate values for the 
latitude and longitude of (1) Mumbai, (2) Kolkata, (3) Singapore, 
(4) Paris.
Fig. 1.4. This sketch shows how the Prime Meridian divides the Earth into 
the Western and Eastern Hemispheres, while the Equator divides it into the 
Northern and Southern Hemispheres. 
    DON’T MISS OUT
The Greenwich Meridian is not the first prime meridian. 
There were others in the past. In fact, many centuries before 
Europe, India had a prime meridian of its own! (Fig. 1.5) It 
was called madhya rekhā (or ‘middle line’) and passed through 
the city of Ujjayinī (today Ujjain), which was a reputed centre 
for astronomy over many centuries. Varāhamihira, a famous 
astronomer, lived and worked there some 1,500 years ago.
Indian astronomers were aware of concepts of latitude and 
longitude, including the need for a zero or prime meridian. 
The Ujjayinī meridian became a reference for calculations in 
all Indian astronomical texts.
