Mapping the Earth
Mapping the Earth is a little more difficult because our  
planet is not a flat surface. It nearly has the shape of a 
sphere. (We say ‘nearly’ because it is not a perfect sphere, 
but is slightly flattened at the poles. However, in practice, 
we will consider it to be spherical.) Representing a sphere 
accurately on a flat sheet of paper is not possible. To 
understand why, peel an orange in such a way that you 
have just three or four large pieces of the skin; then try and 
flatten them on a table — you will see that you cannot do it 
without tearing them at the edges.
Now, consider a globe, which is a sphere on which a map 
is drawn. This may be a map of the Earth, the Moon, the 
planet Mars, the stars and constellations in the sky, etc. 
The physical object, like the one shown in the drawing on 
the next page, is a sphere that is generally made of metal, 
plastic or cardboard.
