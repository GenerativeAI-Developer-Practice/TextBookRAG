The system used in these two examples may be called a 
system of coordinates. Thanks to their two coordinates, 
the stationery shop as well as the chess square on the 
chessboard can be precisely determined.
A similar system of coordinates is used in the world of maps 
to determine the location of any place on a map. Let us see 
how this system works.
b) Latitudes
Let us return to the globe. It is easy to identify the North 
Pole and the South Pole on it. Rotate the globe; while it 
rotates, the fixed points at the top and bottom are the two 
poles. Halfway between them is the Equator; note the circle 
marking it (see Fig. 1.3). 
Imagine that you stand on the Equator and travel towards 
one of the poles; your distance from the Equator increases. 
Latitude measures this distance from the Equator. At any 
point of this travel, you can draw an imaginary line that 
runs east and west, parallel to the Equator. Such a line is 
called a parallel of latitude and it draws a circle around 
the Earth. Again, it is easy to note on the globe that the 
largest circle is the Equator, while the circles marked by the 
parallels of latitude grow smaller as we move northward or 
southward (Fig. 1.3). 
Latitudes are expressed in degrees; by convention, the 
Equator is latitude 0° (zero degree), while the latitudes of 
the two poles are 90° North and 90° South respectively; this 
is noted 90°N and 90°S.
There is a connection between latitude and climate. Around 
the Equator, the climate is generally hot (it is also called 
‘torrid’). As you travel away from the Equator towards one 
of the two poles (in other words, as your latitude increases), 
the climate becomes more moderate (or ‘temperate’). And 
closer to the North or South Pole, the climate grows colder 
(or ‘frigid’). You will learn in Science why this is so, and
